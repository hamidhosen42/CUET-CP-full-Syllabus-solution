About:

  This is a guideline for the Competitive Programmers of CUET in accordance with
their academic calendar. It contains the topics that must be covered within first two years
if you want to qualify for the world finals. The syllabus is divided into four terms. Each
term covers some topic containing detailed tutorials and problem links. Level-1 Term-1
covers the basics of programming Language. Level-1 Term-2 is the most crucial part since
it introduces the basic idea of data structures/algorithms. In Level-2, intermediate/some
advanced topics are covered. The syllabus of Level-3 and Level-4 is not provided here. It’s
your own duty to find out your lacking and focus/specialize on them. The links provided
here will help you in a great deal but there might be many more resources. So always
keep yourself up-to-date.

Guidelines:

   1. Get complete idea about C
   
   2. Get basic idea about C++
   
   3. Try to implement what you think
   
   4. Must participate in Long-Contests (Upto 5 days) that will be held after each class
   
   5. Take help from your Batch-mates, Seniors and Teachers if needed


Expectations:

   1. Able to implement your idea
   
   2. Familiarize with all online judges
   
   3. Read Tamim Shahriar Subeen’s Book completely
   
   4. Solve all the problems of LightOJ beginner’s category
   
   5. Total Number of problems solved: 200+
   
   6. CF rating:
   
   -At the start: 900+
   
   -At the end: 1200+
   
Tips:

   1. Learn about different good resources as well. Geeksforgeeks, emaxx, competitive
programming 3, Mahbubul Hasan Shanto vai’s book on programming contest,
Shafaet Ashraf vai’s blog. These are good, but not just these-there are others.
Google is your friend.

  2. Spend around an hour or two at each problem before searching for solutions
online. Not more than that, because what is important for you at this stage is to
solve more and more problems, and if you spend all your day at one problem, your
overall solve count will be low and you will not learn much. But make sure that you
spend this time wisely-when we say we have worked for an hour, what happens in
reality is that we have worked for just 20 minutes in total, and the other 40 minutes
have been wasted away via other ‘useful’ procrastination. Perhaps learn to adopt
the Pomodoro method.

   3. After seeing the solution to a problem, make sure to understand the solution fully
and absolutely. There should be no doubt regarding anything with the solution,
and if there is, that means you have not understood it fully/internalized it. Problem
solving is more about pattern matching, and being able to match an unseen
problem with problems that you have seen before-but if you haven’t internalized
the solution to the problems that you couldn’t solve by yourself, you have then
actually just memorized it, and memorized stuff doesn’t actually stay in your mind
for long-and you won’t be able to recognize patterns later as well.
